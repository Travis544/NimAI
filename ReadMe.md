This is an AI written Python that teaches itself to play Nim through reinforcement learning.
How Nim works: http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~mec/2003-2004/graphtheory/nim/howtoplaynim.html

Run python play.py.

The ai will first train by playing with itself.

Then the a new game will start with the ai vs the human player
